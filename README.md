## What This Is

A batteries-included starter kit for [NVIDIA NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) — the open-source security stack that wraps OpenClaw agents in enterprise-grade sandboxing, policy enforcement, and inference routing.

## ⚠️ Known Issue: WSL2 + GPU

**NemoClaw v0.0.7 has a confirmed bug on WSL2 with NVIDIA GPUs.** The `nemoclaw onboard` wizard forces `--gpu` on gateway and sandbox creation when it detects an NVIDIA GPU via `nvidia-smi`. On WSL2 with Docker Desktop, the GPU can't be passed through to the k3s cluster inside the gateway container, so every sandbox is dead on arrival.

**This repo includes a full workaround** — see [Quick Start](#quick-start) below or [docs/WSL2-WORKAROUND.md](docs/WSL2-WORKAROUND.md) for the deep explanation.

This affects everyone on WSL2 with an NVIDIA GPU. [Others have reported the same issue.](https://forums.developer.nvidia.com/t/bug-rtx-5070-ti-sandbox-notfound-access-denied-on-nemoclaw-onboarding-wsl2/363769)

## Quick Start

### WSL2 (with or without NVIDIA GPU)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenewguardai/tng-nemoclaw-quickstart.git
cd tng-nemoclaw-quickstart

# Phase 1: Install CLIs (one-time)
chmod +x scripts/*.sh setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Phase 2: Deploy (bypasses nemoclaw onboard --gpu bug)
# Get a free NVIDIA API key at https://build.nvidia.com first
./scripts/wsl2-deploy.sh nvapi-YOUR-KEY-HERE
```

### macOS (Docker Desktop)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenewguardai/tng-nemoclaw-quickstart.git
cd tng-nemoclaw-quickstart
chmod +x scripts/*.sh setup.sh
./setup.sh
./scripts/macos-deploy.sh nvapi-YOUR-KEY-HERE
```

### Native Linux (no GPU issues)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenewguardai/tng-nemoclaw-quickstart.git
cd tng-nemoclaw-quickstart
chmod +x scripts/*.sh setup.sh
./setup.sh
# On native Linux with NVIDIA Container Toolkit, nemoclaw onboard works:
cd ~/.tng-nemoclaw/NemoClaw && nemoclaw onboard
```

---

## How It Works

The setup is split into two phases:

**Phase 1 (`setup.sh`):** Installs prerequisites (Docker, Node.js, Git), clones OpenShell + NemoClaw repos, installs both CLIs, copies TNG policy templates. Works on all platforms.

**Phase 2 (platform-specific deploy):** Creates the OpenShell gateway, inference provider, sandbox, and configures OpenClaw inside the sandbox. On WSL2/macOS, this bypasses `nemoclaw onboard` entirely because of the `--gpu` bug.
