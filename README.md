# 🛡️ TNG NemoClaw Quickstart

**Ship your first secure AI agent in under 30 minutes.**

## What This Is

A batteries-included starter kit for [NVIDIA NemoClaw](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw) — the open-source security stack that wraps OpenClaw agents in enterprise-grade sandboxing, policy enforcement, and inference routing.

This repo gives you:

- **`setup.sh`** — One-command automated deployment (prereqs → OpenShell → NemoClaw → running agent)
- **Production-ready security policies** — HIPAA, SOC 2, financial, legal, and dev/testing templates
- **Pre-configured agent blueprints** — Research, code review, and data analysis agents ready to customize
- **Monitoring scaffolding** — Docker Compose stack with log aggregation and alert rules
- **Vertical opportunity examples** — See where the money is and start building

## Why This Exists

OpenClaw became the fastest-growing open-source project in history. It also had 20% of its plugin marketplace distributing malware, 135,000+ instances exposed to the internet with no auth, and a one-click RCE that let any website hijack your agent.

NemoClaw fixes that. But the docs are early, the tooling is alpha, and most builders haven't touched it yet.

**This repo is your head start.**

---

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thenewguardai/tng-nemoclaw-quickstart
cd tng-nemoclaw-quickstart
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

That's it. The script handles prerequisites, installs OpenShell and NemoClaw, deploys a sandboxed agent with the default lockdown policy, and drops you into a connected session.

### What `setup.sh` Does (Under the Hood)

1. Checks and installs prerequisites (Docker, Git, Node.js)
2. Clones and builds NVIDIA OpenShell
3. Clones NemoClaw and runs the installer
4. Copies TNG policy templates into the deployment
5. Runs a health check to verify everything's live
6. Connects you to your first sandboxed agent

### Manual Setup

If you prefer to go step-by-step, see [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full walkthrough.

## Policy Templates

Every enterprise deployment needs custom security policies. We ship five starting points:

| Policy | Use Case | Network | Filesystem | Inference |
|--------|----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| `base/default-lockdown.yaml` | Maximum restriction baseline | Deny all except inference | `/sandbox` + `/tmp` only | Cloud API only |
| `healthcare/hipaa-agent.yaml` | HIPAA-compliant deployments | Allowlisted EHR endpoints | PHI isolation boundaries | Local NIM only (no cloud) |
| `financial/soc2-agent.yaml` | SOC 2 auditable pipelines | Financial data APIs only | Audit trail on all writes | Configurable |
| `legal/legal-privilege.yaml` | Attorney-client privilege | Internal systems only | Strict read/write logging | Local only |
| `dev/permissive-dev.yaml` | Development & testing | Broad (with logging) | Full sandbox access | Any profile |

See [docs/POLICIES.md](docs/POLICIES.md) for how to write your own.

## Requirements

| | macOS | Linux | WSL2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **OS** | macOS 13+ (Ventura) | Ubuntu 22.04+ | Ubuntu 22.04+ on Windows |
| **Docker** | Docker Desktop for Mac | Docker Engine or Desktop | Docker Desktop with WSL integration |
| **RAM** | 16GB+ | 16GB+ | 16GB+ |
| **GPU** | Not needed (cloud inference) | NVIDIA GPU optional (local inference) | NVIDIA GPU optional |
| **Arch** | Intel or Apple Silicon | x86_64 or aarch64 | x86_64 |

- **NVIDIA API Key:** Free tier at [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com) (for cloud inference)

### How macOS Works

NemoClaw's sandbox uses Linux kernel security (Landlock, seccomp). On macOS, this works because the sandbox runs *inside Docker containers* — Docker Desktop provides a Linux VM under the hood. The NemoClaw CLI is Node.js (cross-platform) and OpenShell ships Darwin binaries. Your Mac never runs Linux primitives directly; the containers handle that.

### WSL2 Users

The scripts auto-detect WSL2 and handle Docker differently (no `systemctl`). If using Docker Desktop, make sure WSL integration is enabled for your distro. If the onboard wizard stops with a cgroup error, run `nemoclaw setup-spark` — see [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).
