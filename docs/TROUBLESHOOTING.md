# TNG NemoClaw — Troubleshooting

## Quick Diagnostics

```bash
# Check everything at once
bash scripts/health-check.sh

# NemoClaw-level health
nemoclaw my-assistant status

# OpenShell-level sandbox state
openshell sandbox list

# Stream logs in real-time
nemoclaw my-assistant logs --follow
```

## Common Issues

### macOS: NemoClaw installer warns about OS / Ubuntu

NemoClaw's installer was written for Ubuntu. On macOS, you may see warnings or the installer may exit early. This is cosmetic — the sandbox runs inside Docker (Linux containers), not on your Mac directly. To finish manually:

```bash
cd ~/.tng-nemoclaw/NemoClaw
npm install
npm link    # or: sudo npm link
nemoclaw onboard
```

### macOS: "openshell: command not found"

OpenShell installs to `~/.local/bin/` which isn't in PATH by default on macOS. Add it:
```bash
# For zsh (default on macOS)
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

# For bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

### macOS: Docker Desktop not enough memory

Docker Desktop defaults to limited memory on macOS. Bump it:
1. Docker Desktop → Settings → Resources
2. Set Memory to at least 8GB (16GB recommended for local inference)
3. Apply & Restart

### WSL2: "Unit docker.service not found" or Docker won't start

WSL2 doesn't use systemd by default. Docker is managed differently:

**If using Docker Desktop (recommended for WSL2):**
1. Open Docker Desktop on Windows
2. Settings → Resources → WSL Integration
3. Enable integration for your Ubuntu distro
4. `docker ps` should now work in WSL2

**If using native Docker in WSL2:**
```bash
sudo service docker start    # NOT systemctl
```

### Onboard stops with "cgroup v2" error

NemoClaw's OpenShell gateway runs k3s inside Docker, which needs cgroup namespace host mode. Fix:

```bash
# Option A: Use NemoClaw's built-in fix
cd ~/.tng-nemoclaw/NemoClaw
nemoclaw setup-spark

# Option B: Manual fix
echo '{"default-cgroupns-mode": "host"}' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo service docker restart    # or sudo systemctl restart docker

# Then re-run onboard
nemoclaw onboard
```

Our `setup.sh` tries to fix this automatically, but if Docker Desktop manages your daemon.json, the fix may not stick. Apply it in Docker Desktop: Settings → Docker Engine → add `"default-cgroupns-mode": "host"` to the JSON.

### NemoClaw installer hangs during npm install

Usually a slow npm registry or network issue. Try:
```bash
# Kill it (Ctrl+C), then run manually with verbose output
cd ~/.tng-nemoclaw/NemoClaw
npm install --verbose

# If it completes, finish the setup
nemoclaw onboard
```

### "nemoclaw: command not found"

NemoClaw's binary isn't in your PATH. Fix:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.tng-nemoclaw/NemoClaw/bin:$PATH"
# Add to your .bashrc or .zshrc to persist
```

### "openshell: command not found"

Same issue, different binary:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.tng-nemoclaw/OpenShell/bin:$PATH"
```

### Install script fails with Docker permission errors

You need to be in the `docker` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in, or:
newgrp docker
```

### "NemoClaw requires a fresh installation of OpenClaw"

If you have an existing OpenClaw install, NemoClaw can't layer on top. Options:
1. Uninstall OpenClaw first, then run `setup.sh`
2. Run NemoClaw on a separate machine or VM
3. Use a Docker container as your base environment

### Sandbox won't start — "Landlock not supported"

Landlock LSM requires Linux kernel 5.13+. Check:
```bash
uname -r
# If below 5.13, you need a kernel upgrade
```

Ubuntu 22.04 ships with 5.15+, so this shouldn't happen on supported distros.

### Agent can't reach inference API

Check your NVIDIA API key:
```bash
# Is it set?
echo $NVIDIA_API_KEY

# Test it directly
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $NVIDIA_API_KEY" \
  https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/models | jq .
```

If using local inference, make sure the NIM container or vLLM process is running:
```bash
docker ps | grep nim
# or
ps aux | grep vllm
```

### Policy changes aren't taking effect

Network policies are hot-reloadable. Filesystem and process policies are NOT — they're locked at sandbox creation. If you need to change filesystem boundaries, you need to destroy and recreate the sandbox.

```bash
# Reapply network policy (no restart needed)
openshell policy apply --network policies/my-policy.yaml

# For filesystem changes — recreate the sandbox
nemoclaw my-assistant stop
# Re-run setup with new filesystem policy
```

### Monitoring stack (Grafana) not showing data

1. Check Promtail is finding the log files:
   ```bash
   docker logs tng-promtail
   ```
2. Verify Loki is receiving data:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3100/ready
   ```
3. Make sure log paths in `promtail-config.yaml` match your actual NemoClaw log locations

### "openclaw nemoclaw" plugin commands fail

The plugin commands are under active development. Use the `nemoclaw` host CLI instead — it's the stable interface. Check the NemoClaw GitHub issues for known plugin bugs.
